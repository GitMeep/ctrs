# Example datasets

Both of these datasets were taken with Lucas Muñoz Ortuñez Slatanach, Magnus Debes and Mikkel Ehlers as part of the course 10031 - Introduction to Engineering Physics at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU).

Both scans were taken on a PHYWE XR 4.0 machine with with the following parameters:

- Acceleration potential: 35 kV
- Anode current: 1 mA
- Exposure time: 1 s
- Source-Object-Distance (SOD): 250 mm
- Source-Detector-Distance (SDD): 320 mm

The measureCT software was calibrated without the sample beforehand.

## Blue Ball

This dataset is a scan of a blue ball with 4 beads of absorbant material inside.

## Rubix

This dataset is a scan of a GAN330 Keychain Cube.
