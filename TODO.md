# TODO

- Project view rays onto images and calculate integral over resulting line instead of sampling multiple points in space
- Filter images for [filtered back-projection](https://www.desy.de/~garutti/LECTURES/BioMedical/Lecture7_ImageReconstruction.pdf) (perhaps do this as well as -ln(sample) in a compute shader?)
